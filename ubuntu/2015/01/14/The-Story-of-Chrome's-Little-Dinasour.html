<p>Did you ever see a little dinosaur on Google Chrome when you lost connection of Internet. It’s cute right.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s a game. If you want to play the game, just shut off your wifi connection and view any webpages, then just hit <code>Space</code> key on your keyboard to get started. </p>
